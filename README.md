# Barcode and QR Code Detector

This project is a Python script that reads an image from a specified path, detects barcodes and QR codes, and displays the image with rectangles drawn around the detected codes. The type and data of each detected code are printed to the console.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, ensure you have the following libraries installed:

- `opencv-python`
- `pyzbar`

You can install these dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install opencv-python pyzbar
pip install -r requirements.txt
